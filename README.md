# Blood Donation System Version 1.0

The Blood Donation System is designed to run on the Blood Bank Server and to allow the donors who wishes to donate blood to get information they require and for system Donor/Contributors to create a new database entry, update and existing entry or contact donor for blood requirements. The data will be held in an MYSQL database on the server.

This Blood Donors System will be completely web-based, web server from a standard web browser. An Internet connection is necessary to access the system.


#System Evolution:

In the future this system will be update to allow donors to query the database and when they require blood for their relatives or friends then they can get them with their credits which they secured when they donated blood.
